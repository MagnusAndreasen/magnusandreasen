  				<dd class="col-sm-9 mb-4">The client needed a simple cocktail recipes website. The website should focus on how to make the drinks, with animations, videos, interactivity and regular text.</dd>

  				<dt class="col-sm-3">Design</dt>
  				<dd class="col-sm-9 mb-4">The design of the website is based on the idea that the page has to be as simple as possible. A great overview of cocktails, a learning page, an about/contact page. The design had to be warm and inviting and therefore there are some carribean vibes included in the design, such as the logo and font.</dd>

  				<dt class="col-sm-3">Development</dt>
  				<dd class="col-sm-9 mb-4">The website has been made with Bootstrap and includes elements of jQuery. A wide range of tools have been used to make the learning activities. For example with videos and animations. The interactivity section has been made with JavaScript.</dd>

  				<dt class="col-sm-3 text-truncate">Reflection</dt>
  				<dd class="col-sm-9">A very big project as everything is made from scratch, including the content. This was a very good learning project, as we also had to use other tools in our toolbox, for example video and photo editing with Premiere Pro and Photoshop. Animations are made with Animate CC and Illustrator. A great project with lots of things learned, but also a lot of things to improve on.</dd>
